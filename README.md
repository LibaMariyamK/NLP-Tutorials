# **Core NLP Basics**

This folder contains the fundamental building blocks of Natural Language Processing (NLP). These notebooks give you a practical and simple introduction to how raw text is converted into usable, machine-ready data.

## **📌 What is NLP?**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
It bridges the gap between **human text** and **machine learning models**.

---

## **📌 Why is NLP Important?**

Modern applications depend heavily on NLP:

* Search engines understanding queries
* Chatbots and virtual assistants
* Text classification (spam detection, sentiment analysis)
* Machine translation
* Information extraction
* Summarization
* Voice assistants

Without proper text preprocessing, none of these systems work reliably.
